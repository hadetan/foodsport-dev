Please follow the stories of [social media stories](../../docs/admin-api-stories.md) and work accordingly. When you have finished any Acceptance Criteria then mark them as checked. If everything is marked as checked then you don't have to implement that again or touch that again unless asked.

If there are any new tables that are not present in the [schema.prisma](../../prisma/schema.prisma) then it is your responsibility to update the schema and run the following migration command as well.
